> A script for managing LaTeX templates.

This originally came out of my hatred of having to manually fill in the pertinent
fields in LaTeX documents for homework (i.e. homework number, due date, collaborators, etc.).
This is a barebones first attempt written in a day, but I hope to add more 
features as time allows.

In addition, more documentation will be placed here soon. 

Finally, there are some dependencies to mention. I'm going to wrap this up
into a homebrew package soon so they will be easy to deal with.
